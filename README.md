# Master Thesis: Wifisim Extension

##ABSTRACT

Since some years wireless communications seem to be at the order of the day, both as homes as in offices, college campuses or larger scale networks. Wireless networks have been imposed over conventional networks due to advantages such as low cost, easy installation, high mobility and network reach. This ultimately results in higher operating comfort for network users.

By contrast, among some of wireless networks disadvantages may be mentioned the easy intrusion between certain less secure settings and increased bit error rate (BER). However, this project has sought to focus on those aspects that significantly reduce the quality of the signal or even the total loss of this, because of the distance and the environment in which it is located.

When installing a WiFi network within a building, we can find coverage problems, as the difference in signal quality at some areas compared to others, and even areas where the signal does not even reach. These problems are closely related, among other reasons, to the position where the access points are on the network. Since this is a drawback that cannot always be solved by using logic due to incident factors.

The main goals of this project are the wireless networks planning, deployment, and optimization by working out the best position of one or more access points within a building. To achieve this end, we have implemented a design tool that obtains the optimal solution by using genetic algorithms, taking into account the increased coverage area and the strongest signal possible.
